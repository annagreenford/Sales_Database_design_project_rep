# Sales_Database_design_project_rep
## Background
You have been hired by a small retail business that wants to streamline its operations by creating a new database system. This database will be used to manage inventory, sales, and customer information. The business is a small corner shop that sells a range of groceries and domestic products. They also have a loyalty program, which you will need to consider when deciding what tables to create.
## Task
Explain the steps you would take to set up and create this database.
## Results
1. Understanding the Business Requirements:  The relational database will need to store information about the products sold, the price they are sold at, any kind of categorisation of these products, and what stock is held for each product; also Information about the customers (delivery/contact details) and their membership of the loyalty scheme, and what sales are made to each customer.  Store assistants would need to enter sales details, update stock when supplier deliveries are made, update loyalty info relating to customers, and potentially add new customers/amend customer details. Store management could use the information to review what items are offered, track how much stock is being held, and direct new supplier orders. Total sales to individual customers can be tracked across time. It could also be used to analyse sales at product or category level to help direct marketing activities, track effectiveness of the loyalty scheme.
2. Designing the Database Schema:  Details are shown in the ![attached schema:](https://github.com/annagreenford/Sales_Database_design_project_rep/images/SalesInventoryDB_schema.png "Image of database schema")
